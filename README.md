  TEMBO DECENTRALIZED WILDLIFE CHARITY PLATFORM
</h1>
 
‚ÄòTembo‚Äô is the Swahili word for Elephant. One of Africa‚Äôs most iconic species is also one of the most vulnerable as they are the most affected by illegal wildlife trade, habitat loss and fragmentation as well as human-wildlife conflict.
Wildlife charity organizations all around the world leave alone Africa, have succeeded in putting efforts in mitigation of impacts of human activity on wildlife population. In doing so, countless sick, injured and orphaned animals have been absorbed into foster care and ultimately released back into the wild.

This is a big leap towards achieving what I would call ‚ÄúA perfect Planet‚Äù, which essentially is humans and wildlife co-existing harmoniously. We can however take it a step further by leveraging blockchain-based technology to support this cause.

Blockchain solutions can enable charities and non-profits to deliver results in entirely novel ways that would be impossible without it. By minimizing administrative costs through automation, providing more accountability through traceable giving milestones, and allowing donors to see more clearly where their funds are going, blockchain may help restore some of the lost credibility to charities that prove worthy of the public‚Äôs trust.

By working with charity organisations, Tembo is aiming to help resurrect the images of charities willing to adopt these services by:
1. Providing charities with a marketplace to reach a ready-to-give audience, this platform will take far fewer fees than traditional marketing and fundraising agencies. 

2. Providing proof of need and proof of receipt to ensure that the cause is indeed a worthwhile one and that the funds reach the intended party and because blockchain lowers administrative costs, more funds can reach the right, needy recipient.

3. Providing a platform for wildlife charity-oriented NFT projects, giving donors and donors a new revolutionary way of supporting the cause.

4. Taking digital adoption of orphaned animals to the next level by leveraging blockchain technology to offer an interactive experience e.g An on chain digital adoption certificate, weekly NFT orphan progress airdrops as well as access to special content.

5. Using the concept of proof-of-personhood to ensure only humans (and not bots) get access to special content posted on the platform. We appreciate that orphaned wildlife content is sensitive and should be protected.
